# truth-table-calculator
A truth table calculator. That's as much as I can do.

# Inputs
AND -> and (^)<br/>
OR -> or (V)<br/>
NOT -> not (-)<br/>
IMP -> implies (->)<br/>
IAOF -> if and only if (<->)

Contain all logic with brackets. Please space your inputs.
A GUI is unfortunately unavailable for now.

# Examples of Valid Inputs for n = 3

((A AND B) IAOI C)<br/>
((A OR B) AND ((NOT A) IMP C))<br/>
(A IMP (B OR C))<br/>
((A AND A) OR B)<=

Even for simple inputs like "A implies B," input them surrounded by brackets.

(A IMP B)<br/>
(A IAOI B)

Hopefully this helps you a little on your Assignment 2.
