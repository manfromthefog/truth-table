# truth-table-calculator
A truth table calculator. That's as much as I can do.

# Inputs
AND -> and (^)
OR -> or (V)
NOT -> not (-)
IMP -> implies (->)
IAOF -> if and only if (<->)

Contain all logic with brackets. Please space your inputs.
A GUI is unfortunately unavailable for now.

# Examples of Valid Inputs for n = 3

((A AND B) IAOI C),
((A OR B) AND ((NOT A) IMP C)),
(A IMP (B OR C)),
((A AND A) OR B),

Even for simple inputs like "A implies B," input them surrounded by brackets.

(A IMP B)
(A IAOI B)

Hopefully this helps you a little on your Assignment 2.
